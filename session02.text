<h2 id='session-setup'>Session Setup</h2>
<p>Last session was pretty long. It took me all day to play through it. It was fun! But, I also want to have growth for my characters, so I’m leveling them up to level 4! I get an ability point! Raswin is going to put it into Charisma to bump up to 18. Dorlanann puts his point into Con to get those sweet, sweet hit points.</p>
<p>I still have the epic adventure looming over their heads, though they aren’t aware of it, “An undead lich will command through threat of violence a horde to maintain rule of law.” I think they’ll start hearing rumors of an undead horde gathering. Where? Karrnath is the obvious choice, I suppose. Let’s ask the oracle: Is the undead horde rumored to be gathering in Karrnath? Even odds, roll: 54, that’s a Yes! That’s where were headed, then. I think d10 days have passed since the last adventure: 5. That will allow them to heal up completely. </p>
<p>I’m also going to try using Roll20 for the combat map since I’m playing at my little desk. That’ll be less setup, less mess to clean up, etc. I’ll still take screenshots to add into the game play. Now, if I could only remember my password… Ok, got in. </p>
<h2 id='session-play'>Session Play</h2>
<p>The pair of adventurers awake to the noises of lower Sharn. They do not have much money. They are, after all, poor veterans of The Last War. Most people want to forget that the war happened. Frankly, Raswin and Dorlanann do, too. But, reminders are all around them. Everyone turns a blind eye to them.</p>
<p>The two go to their favorite street food vendor and get a steaming hot mug and a large meat-filled pastry. As they lounge by the street corner, they chat about what comes next for them.</p>
<p>“The way I see it, we’re good at one thing. Damn good. There should be plenty of work out there for us.”</p>
<p>Raswin swallows his mouthful and answers, “We just have to find it. The work. We have to find the work.” He takes another bite and shrugs. “But, I agree with you, otherwise.”</p>
<p>They finish their breakfast without too much more of consequence being discussed between them. </p>
<blockquote><p>I bet there are job boards here. In a large city like Sharn, there <em>have</em> to be. I’m not even going to ask the oracle. But, I do need to know what <em>kind</em> of jobs there are. Or, maybe I don’t. Is there a job they can do? Good odds: 20, yes. Roll for an event: Praise, War. Well, that’s kind of coincidental, given my descriptions of everyone wanting to forget the war, now. I think I’ll roll that right into the rumors of undead hordes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they are wrapping up their breakfast and tossing the paper wrappers into the trash bin on the vendor’s cart, they hear a voice calling out, clear as a bell. Exchanging a wordless glance, they start to wander that way.</p>
<p>“The peace is unnatural! The war decided nothing, it wasn’t over. War is meant to solve disputes that words cannot! The tensions still exist! And, the other nations are using this respite to prepare for the next round of battles, I swear to you! I received word just last night of an undead army massing in the distant land of Karrnath! They are using those foul creatures again, and swear to wipe us out!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Is the crowd receptive to his words? Bad odds: 68, no. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A wadded up paper wrapper flies through the air and bounces off the dwarf’s bald head, which immediately flushes a bright red. “Who was that?!” he demands. The crowd laughs at him and begins to disperse.</p>
<p>With another exchanged glance, Raswin and Dorlanann wade through the dispersing crowd towards the dwarf.</p>
<p>“You know, you may be right,” Raswin says without introducing himself. </p>
<p>The dwarf brushes crumbs out of his beard from a muffin someone threw at him before bending down to pick up the discarded pastry and brush it off. He takes a bite. “Of course I’m right!” he declares around the mouthful. “And these <em>sheep</em> don’t want to see it.”</p>
<p>Dorlanann sighs. “They’ve been through a lot. Or, think they have.” His dark eyes flash with memories of his time in battle, time most of those civilians know nothing about. “They’re tired of war.”</p>
<p>The dwarf looks the two of them up and down. “But, not you, I’d guess.”</p>
<p>Raswin smiles. “No, not us.” He takes a breath. “Can you tell us more about the rumors of the undead army?”</p>
<p>The dwarf smiles and shoves the rest of the muffin in his mouth. “I can tell you all I know, which isn’t much more than I’ve already said.” He swallows. “Do the two of you plan to take the horde on by yourselves?”</p>
<p>Dorlanann snorts a laugh. “Don’t be stupid. Of course not. But it seems like the kind of thing we want to be involved with. I never got to face the Karrnathi undead. I’d like to test myself against them.”</p>
<p>The dwarf snorts, then looks at Dorlanann and realizes he’s serious. “You’re serious. You’re daft!” He says the last with a smile. “Very well.” He tells them the rumors say the undead horde is collecting in the Ironroot Mountains on the East side of Karrnath.</p>
<blockquote><p>That was a quick play session, but it’s a good start. I’ll have to pick this up later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pair heads to a local supplier and each purchase an adventuring pack for 15gp. They don’t know what they’ll be going up against, exactly, but that basic equipment never hurts. And, the rumors are taking them to the mountains.</p>
<blockquote><p>They’ll each pick up the adventuring pack and start to head out. Via lightning rail, it’s 2k miles to Vathirond on the other corner of Breland. That would be 1k gp each just to get there. That’s a lot of money, money that these two don’t have. They’ll have to buy horses and travel that way. They’ll buy a pony and a light horse with riding saddles, bit and bridle. I suppose they’ll have to buy some saddlebags and feed for the days when there’s no foraging. And! Now that their provisions are purchased, I need to figure out how many days they’ll be on the road. Looks like they can move about 40 miles a day that way. There are Orien trade routes that go from Sharn to Vathirond. I don’t know exactly how much those help and I’ve already looked up a ton of stuff. I’m going to add 10 miles to their daily movement for the roads and call it good. It’ll take them 40 days to get to the other corner of Breland! Wow, Eberron is huge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The journey across Sharn is long and boring. For the most part. Except for that one time…</p>
<blockquote><p>With 40 days, something is bound to happen to them on the road. Let’s see what that is! Event focus: NPC positive, Action: Deceive, Subject: Success. So, since I’m not interested in having scenes that don’t focus on my two PCs, this will involve a new PC they meet on the road. The NPC will be a dwarf merchant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Helomi Shadowrock met them on the road during their second week on the road. Raswin and Dorlanann, already bored of the monotony of travel, welcomed the merchant. He had many stories, most tall tales, they thought, and he shared them from sunup until sunset. He had discovered a new material that he was trying to bring to market, and they could get on the ground floor by investing in his company. He needed some gold to pay for shipping the darkmetal from the mountains past the Eldeen Reaches. He told a good tale and invited them to help him out.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m going to have both PCs roll Sense Motive, DC 20. If they fail, they’ll give him 1d10 gold pieces. Raswin: 18. I rolled a natural 20, but he’s got low Wisdom. 😏 Dorlanann: 4. They each fail and give him 1d10(100)gp. What a pair of suckers! 😆 Do they have a combat encounter while they’re on the road? It’s Breland, which is pretty safe, so I’ll say it’s Bad Odds: 25, that’s a Yes! Time to pull out some random tables. Rolling on the EL 4 Plains table that’s in the DMG, I get 1d3 cockatrices! Rolled and got 1. This thing is territorial, so I guess we blundered too close to its lair! I’ll see if the PCs notice it. Spot: 22 v. Hide: 12. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On their second week, shortly after they invested in Helomi’s endeavor and he rushed away to get the darkmetal moving, a small figure bursts out of the long grass and rushes towards them, shrieking a horrible shriek and staring at them with glowing red eyes.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s just the one, so I’m not going to bother making a map for it. Initiative - Raswin: 13, Dorlanann: 14, Cockatrice: 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cockatrice rushes towards the pair, picking Dorlanann out as he’s the first in line. Flapping its bat-like wings and crying out, it charges.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack! Natural 20. Natural 1 to confirm, so it’s just a normal hit. Rolls a 2-2 for damage, so deals 1. Dorlanann has to roll a Fort save: 12. Holy crap, that was the minimum he could roll and save. Crap-crap-crap!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cockatrice snaps at Dorlanann and finds a bit of flesh not covered by his armor. the nip doesn’t hurt very much, but his skin instantly starts to harden. Dorlanann cries out in alarm, then draws his battleaxe and attacks the monster in return.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 27! Nine damage total. 27hp - 9 = 18hp. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, Dorlanann takes a step back to give Raswin room to work. “Get it!” he cries. Raswin hears the concern, perhaps even fear, lacing Dorlanann’s voice and maneuvers so that his breath won’t catch his companion. Then, he breathes out a line of lightning.</p>
<blockquote><p>The cockatrice has to make a DC 17 Reflex save: 18 on the die which succeeds. I roll 9 damage, so it takes 4. 18hp - 4 = 14hp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cockatrice flaps its awkward wings in a burst of speed and gets <em>mostly</em> out of the way of Raswin’s breath weapon. It croaks its awkward cry and dashes forward to nip at Dorlanann again.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 23, which hits! Damage 2. The Petrification doesn’t say anything about becoming immune to it if you succeed, so I think he has to make another save! Ten on the die, he’s good!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second nip hurts worse and the flesh around the bite tries to harden again, concerning Dorlanann even more. “This thing has magic to its bite!” he calls out as he slashes at it again with his battleaxe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: Natural 1. Miss. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dorlanann is obviously rattled and misses his swing. Raswin, concerned for his traveling companion, his friend, takes another deep breath and lets loose with another line of lightning.</p>
<blockquote><p>Damage: 6, Ref save: 17 on the die. It takes 3 damage. 14hp - 3 = 11hp. I’m so glad I didn’t decide to encounter <em>two</em> of these guys!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cockatrice flutters its wings again, agitated at the electricity that keeps washing over its body. It’s not very smart, and doesn’t realize that the person right in front of it that it views as the threat isn’t the cause to that pain. It launches forward again, pecking at Dorlanann.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 24, hit! Damage: 1. Fort save: 18 on the die, so he’s good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dorlanann grunts as the monster pecks at him again. He takes a step forward, crowding the monster, and swings his weapon again.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 17, Damage: 12. 11hp - 12 = -1. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blade slices through the cockatrices neck and, with another awkward squawk, the monster collapses to the ground. The two heroes stand there, alert, breathing hard as they come down from the sudden battle.</p>
<p>“What is that thing?” Dorlanann asks. </p>
<blockquote><p>Raswin is going to roll Knowledge(Arcana) DC 10 to know. Roll: 22. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raswin moves to toe the body, making sure it’s dead. “It’s a cockatrice,” he says. Then he looks around, “It was probably defending a nest nearby. I bet we could find the eggs.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Do they find the eggs? Search DC 15. Raswin: 15 on the die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They start to look around and before too long, Raswin calls out, “I found them.” Dorlanann moves over to see. In the next are 6 reddish colored eggs. The elf looks at the gnome and asks, “Should we take them with us?” Raswin shrugs and kneels down to begin gathering them. </p>
<p>“Yeah, they won’t survive if they hatch out here in the wild without their momma,” he says, gesturing back to the monster they killed. “Maybe we can find a breeder to sell them to.” </p>
<p>Dorlanann nods. “Makes sense.” </p>
<p>Once Raswin has all the eggs gathered, they mount their horses again, and continue their journey to Varnithor.</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s all the time I currently have to play this game! I’ll continue this scenario at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sun sits high in the sky when the heroes canter into Vathirond on their horses. The residents of the town watch them warily, though perhaps not because of the weapons they openly carry. </p>
<blockquote><p>They’ll roll a Sense Motive to try and understand what is going on. People are wary here of the unknown. The town watch and the Brelish army are here in force because of the nearby border and Mournland. DC 12, roll: 13 by Dorlanann.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“It’s the Mournland,” Dorlanann says without preamble. Raswin looks over at him questioningly. Pointing to the far side of the city, where a towering wall of mist can barely be seen, Dorlanann continues, “The Mournland starts just over there. Its proximity makes every here… jumpy.”</p>
<p>Raswin nods in understanding. Adjusting his position in the saddle of his pony, he says, “We should find a room. A night or two in a bed will do me some good.”</p>
<p>Dorlanann nods. “For me, too. But no longer than the two nights, I think.” His gaze lays still on the mists of the Mournland, a pensive look on his face.</p>
<blockquote><p>They’ll pay for a couple nights at an inn. I’ll just have it cost 3gp each to include meals and stabling. It’s just normal fare, nothing fancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pair spend their first day resting and eating, enjoying the comforts of civilization.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does something happen to disturb their rest? People are constantly on edge, but that might make them more wary of causing problems, as well as a little crazy. I’ll leave it at Even odds. Roll: 91, no. I do want some kind of adventure or quest to pop up, so I’ll use the Oracle cards to generate one. “An outcast will be given by an oracle an antagonistic sentient item to erase a person from reality.” Well, that sounds fun! Let’s use the random tables in the DMG to figure out what <em>kind</em> of item it is. I rolled a scroll. Interesting! How do my heroes get drawn into this conflict? I’ll roll an action from the Mythic 1e generator: PC Negative / Cruelty / War. I think someone recognizes one of the PCs from their time in the war and starts to loudly call them out. Is it the person given the scroll? Even odds: 58, yep!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second morning, Raswin and Dorlanann get up and head down to the common room and get their breakfast. They put their heads together over the meal and start to talk about how they will continue their journey to Karrnath, when the door bursts open and an individual stomps in.</p>
<blockquote><p>Male or female: Female. Race: Dwarf. Class: Rogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The female dwarf looks over at their table and focuses on…</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t figure out which one she’s mad at! Rolled a die: Dorlanann.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… Dorlanann. In a strong voice she screams, “You! You monster! I thought I recognized you when I saw you yesterday.” She stalks closer to the table, and the pair of them scoot their chairs away from the table and stand so they’re not caught sitting down if she gets violent. She gets close to Dorlanann and points a menacing finger at him.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their history is cruelty and war, so I’m thinking one of them was in a POW camp and the other was a guard. Was this woman the prisoner? Good odds: 13, yep!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“‘I’m sorry, I don’t know you,” Dorlanann says to her, his hand creeping to the handle of the axe on his belt.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes you do!” she yells, her finger still held out in his face. “Or, have you forgotten Camp Shatter? And the things <em>you</em> did to us there?”</p>
<p>Dorlanann’s jaw firms up and his eyes narrow. He looks at her again.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does he remember her? Intelligence roll, DC 15 because she probably looks a lot different now than she did in the camp. Roll: 6. He sure doesn’t!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a moment, he shakes his head. “No, I’m sorry, I don’t know you. But, if you <em>were</em> indeed at Camp Shatter, I’ll have you know that I was never cruel to any prisoners. I only followed orders.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Dorlanann is Lawful Neutral, so he indeed followed orders, even when it hurt people. That’s his outlook on life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman sputters, her face turning red. “YOUR ORDERS WERE CRUEL TO US! ALL OF US!” she shrieks. </p>
<blockquote><p>Are the other patrons doing something about this altercation? Or trying to sneak out? Even odds: 94, no they’re not trying to do something about it, so they’re trying to leave surreptitiously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dorlanann’s face goes hard. “It was war. We all did the best we could, following our orders. I was never intentionally cruel to anyone. In fact, I stopped several other soldiers from committing cruel acts on the prisoners. I’m sorry you were in Camp Shatter. But, that is not my fault. The war is over. Let’s all just try to move on.” </p>
<blockquote><p>He’ll roll a Diplomacy to try and get her from Unfriendly to Indifferent. DC 15, Roll: 2. Well, she’s Hostile now! Which matches the “quest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her face goes white, then she rushes out, her footfalls quiet on the wooden floor.</p>
<p>Raswin appears at Dorlanann’s side and in a quiet voice says, “You never told me you were at Camp Shatter.” </p>
<p>Dorlanann, in an equally quiet voice, answers, “It was not a good time. I don’t like to think about it. I followed my orders, just like I was supposed to. I made sure the others in my unit followed the rules for treatment of prisoners. But, I am only one man. And it was a camp for prisoners of war.” He leaves it at that, as if that last statement explained everything.</p>
<p>Actually, it does explain everything, Raswin thinks. It really does.</p>
<p>They spend the next few hours planning the next leg of their journey, deciding to travel by boat to Olath in Thrane. They each charter passage on a ship leaving the next morning, then go shopping to get some additional equipment for their journey.</p>
<p>Their encounter with the cockatrice worried them both, as neither had a way to deal with the monster’s magical bite. </p>
<blockquote><p>They need some potions! They can’t afford much besides some Cure Light Wounds. They’ll each by 3 for 150. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they return to the inn, Dorlanann comments, “We’re going to need to find some paying work soon.”</p>
<p>Raswin nods in response, noticing how much lighter his belt pouch feels. “Yeah, I’m burning through gold at a disturbing rate.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the dwarf woman attack openly? She’s unreasonably mad, but she’s also a rogue. I’ll call it even odds. Roll: 77, critical No! She’s not only going to attack via stealth, she’ll do it at night when they’re asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They bed down in their rooms for the night, ready for an early start the next morning.</p>
<blockquote><p>The rogue is going to sneak into Dorlanann’s room and try to destroy him with the scroll. It will, essentially, be a scroll of Disintegrate. Normally, the rogue wouldn’t be able to use it without a difficult Use Magic Device check, but the scroll is also intelligent. The question is, does Dorlanann detect her before she starts casting the spell from the scroll? DC 20, Listen roll: 21. Holy crap, the highest he could roll! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dorlanann’s eyes open as something disturbs his rest, and he takes a moment to think through what it was that woke him. There it was again, the soft click as the door re-latches. Quickly, he rolls out of bed, grabbing his sword and drawing it from where it lies next to his bed, and stands in the darkness. His eyes adjust to the dim light and he sees the dwarf woman standing in his room.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll roll initiative to see who goes first. I’ll give her a +8 to her initiative as she’s a rogue. Me: 10, Her: 9. Luck is on my side this morning!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dorlanann looks the dwarf woman over. She’s not holding a weapon, no naked blade or the like, but she is holding a tube in one hand. Dorlanann recognizes its like: a spell scroll! Immediately, he swings his sword, trying to knock the scroll from her hand. </p>
<blockquote><p>She’s not considered armed with that scroll, so this doesn’t provoke an Attack of Opportunity. Still, she needs to make an attack roll v. mine. She’ll have a bonus of +7. Her: 10, Me: 29. Jeez, luck is <em>really</em> on my side this morning!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His blade slices through the darkness and smacks the scroll, breaking her grip on it. The scroll clatters to the floor. “That’s enough,” Dorlanann says to her, pointing his sword at her throat.</p>
<blockquote><p>Does she attack? She’s lost the element of surprise, which is important for a rogue. But, she’s unreasonably angry. I’ll leave it at even odds. Roll: 85, no she does not! I think she’ll withdraw, which is a full round action. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving the scroll on the ground, the dwarf ducks under Dorlanann’s sword and slams into the door, throwing the latch open, and rushes out into the hallway. Her feet pound the floor as she flees. Dorlanann is close on her heels, speeding after her down the hall. In pure speed, she can’t outrun him, he knows. But, this is her hometown. She knows it better and might have a short cut to take to hide from him.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll make opposed Intelligence rolls for this chase. She’s at a +3 I think. He’s at a +1. Her: 16, Me: 3. Luck is a cruel, cruel mistress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They twist and turn through the inn, bursting out the back door into the alley behind the building. Dorlanann follows her, trying to keep her in sight, but she’s just too quick, and soon disappears. The half-elf takes a moment to try and find her trail, but it’s no use; she’s gone.</p>
<p>Disgusted, he returns to the inn, where he finds lights flickering on, and other patrons in the hall wondering what all the noise and commotion was. Dorlanann quickly explains to them about the attacker. Someone suggests calling the guard, but Dorlanann dismisses that. There was no harm done, and he doesn’t believe she’ll return tonight. And, he’ll be leaving in the morning.</p>
<p>Raswin is one of those in the hallway, and they exchange some quick words. Together they step into Dorlanann’s room and look for the scroll that the fighter knocked out of his would-be attacker’s hands.</p>
<blockquote><p>Has the scroll disappeared? It’s an intelligent magic item, so I think there are good odds that it disappears, perhaps to resurface at a later date! Roll: 60, yarp it’s gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scroll is nowhere to be found, though they search for a long time. </p>
<p>“Perhaps someone came in here and took it,” Raswin suggests. </p>
<p>Dorlanann shakes his head. “That is a very disturbing thought.” Raswin agrees.</p>
<p>Dawn is just a few hours away, and they both decide there is no more sleep to be had this night. They quietly pack up their gear and leave the inn, heading towards the docks and their ride.</p>
<blockquote><p>I will add the dwarf rogue and the intelligent scroll of disintegrate to my NPC list. I’ll give her the name Dolirra Flatcloak. The scroll’s name will be Idenorim. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They find the crew already up and working on loading the ship. They talk to the captain who shows them to their cabin and demands they stay out of the way while his crew is working. He says they’ll leave with first light. </p>
<p>The pair of heroes lay on their bunks, staring at the ceiling. Raswin yawns as the short night starts to catch up to him. Dorlanann wonders aloud if they’ll ever see the dwarf woman again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Raswin says after a pause. “She seemed very angry. But, she also ran away after you knocked the scroll from her hand. Maybe she realized you weren’t going to be such an easy target?”</p>
<p>Dorlanann ponders that for a moment. “Perhaps. But, I think she might be the type to come back and try again. We’ll have to keep an eye out for her.”</p>
<p>Raswin nods. “Then that’s what we’ll do.”</p>
<blockquote><p>The ship can make about 48 miles per day, per the Explorer’s Handbook. They are traveling 500 miles. That’s going to be a trip of just under 11 days. Is there an attack during this time? Even odds, I’d say. Roll: 22. That is a critical yes! Given the location, the attack probably comes from the Mournland. From there, it could either be followers of the Lord of Blades, or some crazy undead. I’ll flip a coin between the two: Lord of Blades! That’s probably the more interesting result, anyway. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the third day of the trip, a cry goes out from some of the deckhands. A ship has emerged from the mists bordering the Mournland and is pursuing this one. Dorlanann and Raswin make their way quickly to the deck, moving around the deckhands who are rushing about, tugging on lines and adjusting sails to try and coax more speed from them. The heroes watch as the pursuing ship quickly gains on them. On the deck of the other ship, they see several figures, spikes jutting out from a good number of them. The other figures brandish large blades and other weapons, crying out challenges and insults. </p>
<p>“There’s always something in our way, isn’t there?” comments Raswin. </p>
<p>Dorlanann only nods and smiles. “Yes, but would you have it any other way?” he asks.</p>
<p>Raswin’s return smile is honest. “No. Not really.” He turns to the approaching ship and prepares for battle.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now I can set up the battle on Roll20! Since this was a critical yes, it is going to be a very tough challenge. I think I’ll have them go up against 2 Warforged Rogues 2 from the Forgotten Forge adventure, and the Fighter 3. That should be a CR 5 or 6 encounter? I’m not super good with the CR system, but both my characters are combat oriented. Let’s see how this pans out!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="WarforgedRiverAttack.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Warforged River Attack"></p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve got the battlefield set up and now it’s time to roll Initiative! The rogues will be a group and the fighter will roll alone. Dorlanann: 9, Raswin: 18, Fighter: 6, Rogues: 17. Order is Raswin, Rogues, Dorlanann, Fighter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The warforged ship pulls alongside their ship and a cry for battle rings out. Raswin doesn’t wait for them to swing over, he just inhales and then breaths out a line of lightning after taking a step to his right. The line washes over the red rogue and the fighter behind them.</p>
<blockquote><p>They need to make a Reflex save DC 17. Rogue: 18, Fighter: 1 on the die, so he has no chance of succeeding. Damage: 10. The rogue takes half. Red Rogue: 9-5/4, Fighter: 28-10/18. Well, that was a great opening salvo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Warforged fighter, standing behind his companions, cries out for them to attack the sorcerer, pointing at Raswin. Then, he lifts his crossbow and fires a bolt at the gnome. </p>
<blockquote><p>Attack roll: 19 on the die which is a threat, 14 to confirm, it IS a critical! 13 damage, 5 of which is fire. I forgot Raswin was still carrying damage from the cockatrice attack. Would it have healed? Yeah, it would be all gone. That puts him at 22hp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bolt slams into Raswin’s shoulder and it explodes with flame. The gnome cries out in anger and pain. Dorlanann yells out a challenge, slamming his axe against his shield.</p>
<blockquote><p>He doesn’t have any ranged weapons, so he’ll ready an attack. He’ll move to engage and attack anyone who comes over to their ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The red rogue brings up his own crossbow and points it at Raswin, loosing the bolt. </p>
<blockquote><p>Attack roll: 17, that hits! Ouch. Damage: 7. Raswin’s at 15hp. That is not good. Also, oops, I went out of order. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blue rogue rushes forward, leaping across the distance between the two ships to board it. </p>
<blockquote><p>Jump check DC 20 as he didn’t have a 20’ running start. He only has a +1 to this. Roll: 14. That was a poor idea. I didn’t do that on purpose to reduce the difficulty of the encounter, I swear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blue rogue leaps off of their ship and leaps out towards Raswin and Dorlanann’s ship, arms outstretched. He misses the leap and falls with a loud splash into the river between them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also, wow, I went really out of order. The fighter should have gone last. Derp. Oh well, I’ll start a new round now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raswin inhales and breathes out another line of lightning before ducking down behind the ship’s railing. The crossbow bolts hurt, and he doesn’t want to get hit by any more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Reflex saves from the rogue and fighter. Rogue: 2 on the die, fails. Fighter: 18 on the die, success! Rogue: 9-8/1hp. Fighter: 18-8/10. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remaining rogue lifts their crossbow and points it at Raswin, who is mostly behind the cover of the ship’s railing. </p>
<blockquote><p>Raswin gets a +6 to his AC as he’s crouching behind the cover. Attack: 18, which is not enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crossbow bolt thunks into the ship railing in front of Raswin and he thanks the gods for their protection. Dorlanann calls out to them, inviting them over to participate in true combat.</p>
<blockquote><p>He readies another action to attack anyone that comes over. They do <em>want</em> to come over, as they’re trying to take this ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The warforged fighter pulls out a rope with a grappling hook attached and throws it into the ship’s rigging to swing over. </p>
<blockquote><p>Use Rope check: 15. That’s a success!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the grappling hook secure, the warforged swings across to land on the heroes’ ship.</p>
<blockquote><p>That’ll just be movement. He only has 20’ of movement, but that would land him in the water. I’ll cheat a little and put him just on the ship. He’s right in front of Dorlanann, who will attack. Also, Fighter has 2DR, so I’ll give him 4 more hp. 14hp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The warforged fighter lands on the deck with a loud thump. Dorlanann is ready and swings his battleaxe at him with a warcry.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 21, hit. Damage: 10. 14hp-8/6hp. Dorlanann’s initiative now drops to after the Fighter. New round!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raswin scrambles around the Fighter, keeping out of his reach, maneuvering so he can get the Fighter and Rogue in the line of his breath weapon, then exhales the line of lightning again.</p>
<blockquote><p>They both make saves v. DC 17. Fighter: 18 on the die. Rogue: 20. They both succeed so take half damage. Damage: 5, so they both take 2. The fighter takes none. Rogue: 1-2/-1. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lightning washes over the fighter, who shrugs it off as if it were nothing. The line continues and strikes the rogue, who falls to the deck of his ship in an inert mass. The Fighter grimaces at Dorlanann, then takes a step to the side to swing his weapon at Raswin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Attack: 16, that hits. Damage: 11. He’s now at 4hp. Yikes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blade slices into Raswin’s thigh and he cries out in pain. Dorlanann yells out in rage and swings his own battleaxe at the warforged. </p>
<blockquote><p>23, hit. Damage: 9-2, 7 damage. 6hp-7/-1. The warforged goes down with a solid thump. Combat is over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sounds of battle die down as the warforged ship turns away to return to the mists of the Mournland. The crew begin to clean up the damage, and push the warforged bodies off the deck and into the water. Dorlanann glances at the weapons the enemies were using, but doesn’t see anything that looks to be of value.</p>
<blockquote><p>He rolled and appraise check and failed. Which, I suppose means he estimates the +1 longsword wildly wrong. But, it’s still worth something, even if he see it’s worth 50% its true value. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except for the fighter’s longsword. That looks like it might be worth something. He decides to keep that, as the crew take things of value from the body and push it overboard.</p>
<p>Days later, the ship pulls into Olath. They disembark and walk into the small town. They’re still far from their destination, and things have been rather exciting for them. Still, they’re doing good work, or will once they arrive at the Ironroot Mountains.</p>
<p>They quickly find rooms at a small in for 5sp each, and set to resting. It was an eventful trip.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll end this session here. Next time, they’re going to have to get a paying job to help finance their travel to the mountains. Having encounters during this travel has been pretty fun, and really makes the lich storyline feel more epic. It’s far away, distant, but always on the horizon. It’s the big goal, but there are a lot of challenges to face before reaching it.</p>
