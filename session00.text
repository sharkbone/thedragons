<h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>
<p><strong>Why am I playing this game?</strong> To indulge in my love for and desire to play D&amp;D 3.5. It’s the game I started with and have always loved (sometimes more vocally than others) and never really gotten to play. I want to play it for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>What do I hope to get out of this game?</strong> A fun adventure using interesting classes. Also, I hope it will give me a cause, motivation, etc, for some web development practice. I want to create a website to share this content and iterate it into something I can be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>How long will the game run?</strong> I have no real limit, but I’m hoping to go through multiple levels and gain more power for the characters. I also want to be able to iterate the website several times to build more functionality into it and practice more things.</p>
<p><strong>Is character death on the table?</strong> Absolutely, though I want it to be meaningful. If it’s not meaningful, I reserve the right to make a tweak to the story to save the character. In past games, I’ve used a house-rule that a character can come back from the dead with a lingering wound, something that changes them. I’ll use that rule.</p>
<p><strong>Format?</strong> While I’d love to do podcast format, I mainly want to use this game as web dev practice. So, adding audio editing to it seems like too much. I’ll keep it text-based. For future “sessions”, game narration will be in normal text and out of character/mechanics comments will be made in blockquotes or a similar tag.</p>
<p><strong>What about character creation?</strong> I love rolling for stats, so I’ll be doing that by rolling 4d6 and dropping the lowest, then arranging them as I wish. I’ll be starting at 3rd level, with the characters having experience in the Last War. I’ll be using LA 0 races. I think I’ll be running a Human Dragonfire Adept, and a Half-elf Medani Fighter. The Medani <em>might</em> be dragonmarked, though I haven’t decided for sure yet. And, I know Fighter’s are rather underpowered, but I’m not playing this game for min-maxing potential. I’m just having fun and my Dragonfire Adept needs someone who can absorb some hits for them.</p>
<p><strong>What world am I playing in?</strong> Eberron, of course! I love that setting, it’s so rich and fun. I invested a lot in those books and I want to use them. Granted, I might not use <em>all</em> of them or <em>much</em> of the ones I do use. But, Eberron is great and having all that material available to use is wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Content/Warnings?</strong> This is really just for me. I don’t anticipate getting a huge following for this project, but as I <em>am</em> putting it online, I should put some kinds of limits on content. I enjoy violence in stories, so I won’t shy away from that. However, I won’t write gratuitously gory descriptions. Relationships may show up, along with sex, though again it won’t be explicitly described. I’m definitely not in for sexual abuse on screen. It may be suggested or be a beat in a story, but I have no interest in narrating that kind of scene. I love stories about corruption, so mental corruption or body horror might show up.</p>
<p><strong>What oracles/solo tools will I be using?</strong> I’ll be using The Oracle Story Generator from Nord Games for story seeds, probably the Event Table from 1e Mythic, the Game Master’s Apprentice deck, and Rory’s Story Cubes (if I can find mine). I won’t use them all at once, but switching between those for different “sessions” can really add some interesting twists. I’ll also use my own Yes/No oracle, rolling d100:</p>
<figure class='table-figure'><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Odds</th><th>Yes</th><th>No</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Bad Odds</td><td>30 or less</td><td>31 or more</td></tr><tr><td>Even Odds</td><td>60 or less</td><td>61 or more</td></tr><tr><td>Good Odds</td><td>90 or less</td><td>91 or more</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<p>A roll of doubles is a critical result, Yes or No. </p>
<p>I know it’s not <strong>exactly</strong> even odds, but I like that it skews more towards a Yes result. I think those are all the details I want to document before I start character creation!</p>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p><strong>What is the first epic quest the characters will set out on?</strong> Knowing this will help create characters. I’ll be using The Oracle Story Generator here. I won’t, however, be drawing the final card (Development) because I want to let the situation play out through my play of it. “An undead lich will command through threat of violence a horde to maintain rule of law.”</p>
<p>So, the most obvious lich in Eberron is Lady Illmarrow. Buuuuut, I don’t think I’ll use her. I used her in the last Eberron game I ran, the last <em>two</em> Eberron games I ran. Let’s create someone special for this game. This is the epic quest that they’ll be working on, but that’s going to be a slow burn. I need something more immediate, as well: “A lazy city watch needs to hide a goblin camp with bugbear allies for a time to recover stolen magic items.”</p>
<p>That’s a… very interesting side quest. So, a city watch person has asked the pair of adventurers to hide a goblin camp for a time. I guess the city watch person wants to recover the stolen magic items themselves, but can’t be bothered to go deal with it immediately? This is an odd one. I’m not sure how that’ll play out, but I think it’s good enough to kick off some action. Maybe the watch person doesn’t know where the goblin camp is, and needs us to locate it, then make sure no one else finds it, until they can get a group together to go get the items back. That sounds doable.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Generation Rolls:</strong> The time has come to start building these characters! Woo!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dragonfire Adept:</em> 12, 17, 8, 15, 13, 7. Those two low ones are <strong>brutal</strong>. Decided to go with a Gnome instead of Human, so final Ability scores are: Str 6, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 13, Wis 7, Cha 17. That could go very poorly for them! 😆</li>
<li><em>Fighter:</em> 7, 13, 13, 18, 13, 11. Well, I got an 18, which is nice! The rest are bleh. This character is a half-elf so I just need to assign their ability scores: Str 18 (of course), Dex 13, Con 13, Int 13, Wis 11, Cha 7. They’ll definitely need to hang back and let the DFA do all the talking. 😏</li>

</ul>
<p>Those aren’t <em>great</em> rolls, but I think they’ll be fun to play. Let’s roll with ‘em! I don’t think much more needs to be documented here for character creation. I’ll set this aside and get both characters done!</p>
<p><em>Cue Jeopardy music…</em> </p>
<p>Now that the characters are mechanically done, I really need to come up with their details and names. It took me quite a long time to get them both done, probably a couple hours. The rest shouldn’t take too long, but I’m tired of sitting in this chair. It’s time to move around and shower.</p>
<p>To get an idea of where they come from, which will help me decide on some details, I’ll document what backstory I have for them:</p>
<p><em>These two characters served during the Last War. They didn’t serve together, but met on opposing sides at least a couple times. They were both impressed by the other, so that when they encountered each other in a tavern more than a year later, they had to sit and talk. They talked long into the night and formed a budding friendship. As they both were soldiers and both were out of work, they decided to work together as mercenaries. They call themselves “The Dragons” because one bears a Dragonmark and the other wields the breath of dragons.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dorlanann d’Medani, Half-Elf Fighter 3:</strong> Dorlanann is short at 5’ 3”, weighs 164lbs, is 27 and has dark brown skin with vibrant green eyes. He is LN and worships the Sovereign Host. He hails from Sharn.</p>
<p><strong>Raswin Lyrris, Gnome Dragonfire Adept 3:</strong> Raswin comes from Zilargo, like most gnomes. He is even shorter than his companion at 3’ 5” tall and weighs 45lbs. He has light skin with blue-white scales growing on his back and upper arms. </p>
<p>These characters are <em>done!</em> Next step is to start playing. We’ll start in Sharn, because lots of great Eberron stories start there. And, we can do some urban exploring to find the goblinoid camp.</p>
